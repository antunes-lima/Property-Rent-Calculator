# Deplyment - Streamlit

———————————————————————————————
  
This section is related to deploying the model trained in the previous step. 
  
Made using Streamlit framework on Python.

This folder includes the Python script needed to implement the framework, using the model to predict new data.
The next step would be to host it in a cloud virtual machine, so it could be accesible from the web, and not only locally.
